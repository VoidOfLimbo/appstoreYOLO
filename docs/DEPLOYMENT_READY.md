## ✅ Tested and Working

- ✅ Application launches successfully
- ✅ All packages included (7+ GB of dependencies)
- ✅ PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 support
- ✅ TensorRT 10.13.3.9
- ✅ GUI framework (PyQt5)
- ✅ All utilities and dependencies

## 🚀 How to Use on Another PC

### Step 1: Transfer the File
Copy `TensorRT_Converter_Portable.zip` to the target PC via:
- USB drive
- Network share
- Cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)

### Step 2: Extract
Right-click → Extract All
Or use 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.

### Step 3: Run
Navigate to extracted folder and double-click:
**`TensorRT_Converter.bat`**

That's it! No installation needed!

## ⚠️ Target PC Requirements

The ONLY things the target PC needs:

✅ **Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)**
✅ **NVIDIA GPU** (GTX 1050 or better)
✅ **NVIDIA Drivers** (latest recommended - 525.60+)
✅ **~8 GB free disk space** (after extraction)

### Does NOT Need:
❌ Python
❌ CUDA Toolkit
❌ TensorRT installation
❌ Visual Studio
❌ Any Python packages
❌ pip, conda, or any package managers

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test on the target PC:

1. [ ] Extract ZIP file
2. [ ] Double-click `TensorRT_Converter.bat`
3. [ ] Check GUI appears correctly
4. [ ] Verify hardware detection shows GPU info
5. [ ] Test file drag-and-drop
6. [ ] Test browse button
7. [ ] Try converting a small test model
8. [ ] Check output directory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Windows protected your PC"
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Or right-click .bat file → Properties → Unblock

### Application won't start
1. Check NVIDIA drivers are installed
2. Make sure GPU is enabled in Device Manager
3. Try running as Administrator
4. Check Windows Event Viewer for errors

### "TensorRT not found" (unlikely now)
- This should NOT happen anymore!
- All TensorRT files are included in python_embedded/Lib/site-packages/tensorrt/
- If it still appears, check that extraction completed fully

### Slow startup
- First run may be slower (Windows indexing)
- Antivirus may scan files on first run
- Normal after first launch

## 📝 Distribution Notes

### For GitHub Release
Upload both:
1. `TensorRT_Converter_Portable.zip` (full package)
2. `README.txt` (from inside the package)

### File Sharing Tips
- Split into parts if needed (use 7-Zip or WinRAR split feature)
- Consider cloud storage with direct download links
- Google Drive: May scan for viruses (up to 25 MB)
- OneDrive: Good for large files
- Dropbox: 2 GB free limit

### Version Control
The package includes `version_info.json`:
```json
{
  "app_name": "TensorRT Converter",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "python_version": "3.10.11",
  "build_date": "2025-10-22",
  "dependencies": {
    "pytorch": "2.6.0+cu124",
    "tensorrt": "10.13.3.9",
    "cuda": "12.4"
  }
}
```

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your application is now **truly portable** and **self-contained**!

### What Changed from PyInstaller Version?
